# 🤖 Webots Color Detection Robot with Linear and Rotary Actuators

This project is designed to simulate a **color detection robot** in the **Webots** environment.  
It combines **image processing**, **actuator control**, and **robotic perception** — built entirely by a student passionate about electronics and robotics.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to **detect colored objects** (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) using a **camera sensor** in Webots, and to understand how a robot can recognize its environment and react through:
- **Linear actuators** (for linear motion)
- **Rotary actuators** (for rotation or orientation control)

This project is an **educational experiment** for learning how **computer vision** and **mechatronics** work together — the same principles used in **industrial robots** and **autonomous systems**.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As an **Electronics and Computer Science student**, I’m deeply interested in **robotics and automation**.  
This project helped me learn:
- How a robot "sees" through a **camera**.
- How to process and filter images using **OpenCV**.
- How to control motion using **linear and rotary actuators**.
- How to simulate robotic systems safely before building real prototypes.

My long-term dream is to work in the **robotics industry** — building intelligent, automated systems that can see, move, and make decisions just like humans.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Detects multiple colors (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue)  
✅ Uses HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model for accurate filtering  
✅ Filters out background noise for clear object recognition  
✅ Displays bounding boxes around detected colors  
✅ Integrates camera input with actuator control  
✅ 100% beginner-friendly Python code with comments

## ⚙️ Hardware Simulation Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Camera** | Captures live images for color detection |
| **Linear Actuator** | Moves the robot part in straight motion (e.g., extend/retract) |
| **Rotary Actuator** | Rotates the robot or camera platform |
| **Computer (Controller)** | Processes the image and controls actuators |

These represent real-world robotic components that can later be implemented with **DC motors**, **servo motors**, or **stepper actuators** in an actual physical robot.
